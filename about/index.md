# About Me

Hello! I'm a product leader and technologist who enjoys bridging the gap between cutting‑edge research and practical applications. Over the years I've worked on projects ranging from AI‑powered recommendation systems to enterprise strategy frameworks. In this blog I share what I've learned along the way, hoping to inspire others and spark thoughtful discussion.

I believe in accessible technology for everyone. This site was designed to meet the **WCAG 2.3 AA** guidelines for accessibility. If you encounter any issues when using this site, please [get in touch](mailto:example@example.com) so I can address them.
