Product management sits at the crossroads of customer needs, technical feasibility and business viability. Here are some timeless principles I’ve learned:

* **Start with the problem.** Always ground your work in a real user need. Avoid falling in love with a solution before validating that the problem exists and is worth solving.

* **Prioritise ruthlessly.** There will never be enough time or resources to build everything. Use frameworks like RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) or MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won’t) to guide trade‑offs.

* **Ship iteratively.** Embrace a mindset of continuous delivery. Small, frequent releases allow you to gather feedback early and often, reducing risk and enabling course corrections.

* **Communicate clearly.** Effective product managers are great storytellers and translators. Keep stakeholders aligned by sharing progress, challenges and context regularly.

Over the coming months I’ll share case studies and practical tools that have helped me in my own product journey. Stay tuned!
