Welcome to my new blog! Over the coming weeks and months I’ll be exploring topics that sit at the intersection of technology, business strategy and product development.

I’ve started this platform because I believe there’s tremendous value in sharing knowledge openly. Whether you’re a seasoned practitioner or just starting out in one of these fields, I hope the ideas and resources here will help you think differently about your work.

In particular, you can expect posts about:

- **Artificial intelligence** – practical insights into how AI is being applied today and what’s on the horizon.
- **Strategy** – frameworks and mental models to help make smarter decisions in uncertain environments.
- **Product management** – hands‑on techniques for building and iterating products that truly solve user problems.

Everything published here will strive to be accessible to readers using assistive technologies. If you spot something that could be improved from an accessibility perspective, please don’t hesitate to reach out.
