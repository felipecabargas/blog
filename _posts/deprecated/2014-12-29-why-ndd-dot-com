### R.I.P. CABARGAS.com 2010-2014
---

I lost CABARGAS.com domain after the auto-renewal process failed. Now a f*cking scammer has the domain, and I don't want to pay them a lot of money to get it back.

Everything that were on cabargas.com now is live on [cabargas.me](http://cabargas.me) with *the only exception* [ðŸŽµ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J7J_IWUhls) of this blog. I moved it to a domain that I wanted to use for some time. So, this is **NonDrivenDevelopment.com**, here you find all my IT stuff, all the TDD nightmares, some git [pro-tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYBjVTMUQY0), the Django challenges that I have right now (and the Ruby ones as always).

As the title states, I want this blog to be a journey across the pains of being a developer, to help others to avoid some *[n00b](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQw65XZ9Tm8)* mistakes (no, I will not write about missing semicolons, it's called a metaphor).

Thanks for visiting!

P.S.: As a side-effect of the domain death my new public email is *contact@cabargas.me*
