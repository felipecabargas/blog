In the past 6 months I've been re-designing [Flythegap](http://www.flythegap.com) platform. It has not been easy: as a design person (I'm not a designer) I always appreciated beauty over functionality, if I go over the last few years I found myself searching the web for Behance popular projects, complex yet beautiful UIs in Dribbble & the craziest things that you can imagine done in pure CSS.

But at the end of the road, when I was starting to develop the first sketches for our platform, they got a everyday more complex. And there is the problem: the developer mindset. All of us, as IT geeks never think that our users are not advanced users.

Luckily [Marco Buonvino](https://twitter.com/MarcoBuonvino) is part of our team. He is our UX Jedi Master, and we developed a great work relationship, that helped me understand that not all that shines is gold, not even in the design world. From there on we've been simplifying the UI, testing it and IMHO we're achieving a really great product.

How? By understanding that *good* UI **equals** UX. No because you think is great users understand it. It may be the copy, it may be the placement, it may be the colors, it may be the product itself.

A good round of User Testing can even change your MVP roadmap, or your business model. In fact, the user tests showed us what features were unnecessary and which ones we never thought about but were crucial for the business.

My recommendation for all of you reading this is that sometimes you need to stop thinking that your frontend is just the way to show your data model, because it's the opposite, your backend is just the way to ensure your users to find what they need, **WHERE** they expect it to be.
