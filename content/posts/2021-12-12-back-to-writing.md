Hello there! It's been a few years (5+ years and a pandemic!) since I last updated this blog.

Seems like yesterday and I actually have notes and sketches of "upcoming" articles I wanted to write but never got around to. 2019 was a weird year, I moved abroad and this tool remained unused, then 2020 hit, and well... you know what happened in 2020.

So here we are, on 2023 and I plan to use this as more than just a tool to write about work related stuff.

So if you're still here, I thank you for your attention, and I invite you to look again soon as I move forward writing about a bit of everything.
