As some of you might noticed, it seems emptier here. After thinking for a while, I decided to take out most of the content out of this website in order to start fresh.

### Why?

When I started this blog (circa 2011), I was just starting on development, I was part of my student union, political organizations and that shows. Alongside that, most of the 2011-2014 stuff was written in Spanish, which in the spirit of global communication doesn't make any sense.

### What now?

The intention today of this blog is to be purely technical, so please expect more **[TIL Tipss]**, **[Design]** & **[Programming]** articles, on a more consistent basis. I have tons of drafts saved since I started this process.

I've been spending these lasts months learning new technologies, so I hope to bring exciting and fresh content for all of you!.
