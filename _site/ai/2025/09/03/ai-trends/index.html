    <p>Artificial intelligence continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Here are a few themes I’m watching closely as we head into 2025:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Responsible AI becomes mainstream.</strong> Organisations are moving beyond AI ethics pledges and beginning to bake principles like fairness, accountability and transparency into their development workflows. Expect more open‑source toolkits and regulatory guidance to support these efforts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Edge computing meets machine learning.</strong> With advances in model compression and specialised hardware, we’re seeing more powerful models running on devices at the edge. This reduces latency and preserves privacy by keeping data local.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Foundation models and fine‑tuning.</strong> Large foundation models (like language and vision transformers) are enabling rapid prototyping through fine‑tuning. Businesses that can quickly adapt these models for domain‑specific tasks will gain a competitive edge.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The field is broad, but focusing on these trends will help you stay ahead of the curve. In future posts I’ll dive deeper into each of these areas and share practical tips for product teams.</p>
