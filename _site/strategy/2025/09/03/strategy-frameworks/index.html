    <p>Great strategy isn’t just about setting a destination – it’s about choosing how you’ll get there when the path is uncertain. Here are a few frameworks I frequently use:</p>

<h3 id="ooda-loop">OODA Loop</h3>

<p>Originally developed for fighter pilots, the Observe–Orient–Decide–Act loop encourages continuous situational awareness and rapid iteration. In business contexts it reminds us to ground decisions in real‑time feedback rather than rigid plans.</p>

<h3 id="wardley-maps">Wardley Maps</h3>

<p>Wardley Mapping visualises the evolution of components in a value chain against market maturity. This helps teams understand where to invest in innovation versus commoditise. Drawing your own map can reveal surprising insights about your competitive landscape.</p>

<h3 id="three-horizons-model">Three Horizons Model</h3>

<p>This framework separates initiatives into three horizons: core activities (H1), growth opportunities (H2) and future bets (H3). Balancing investment across these horizons allows organisations to sustain the present while building for the future.</p>

<p>These tools are complementary and no single framework fits every situation. The key is to experiment and adapt them to your context, and to revisit your strategy regularly as conditions change.</p>
